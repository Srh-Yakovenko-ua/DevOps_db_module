# Terraform and provider version constraints for the whole project.
#
#   * aws        - all cloud infrastructure (VPC, ECR, EKS, IAM, S3/DynamoDB).
#     Pinned >= 5.40 because the EKS module uses the access_config block
#     (authentication_mode / cluster creator admin) added in that release.
#   * kubernetes - the gp3 StorageClass and the namespaces created in-cluster.
#   * helm       - installs metrics-server, Jenkins and Argo CD from their charts.
#     Pinned to the 2.x line: its provider config uses the nested `kubernetes {}`
#     block, which 3.x replaced.
#   * tls        - reads the EKS OIDC issuer thumbprint for the IRSA provider.
#   * random     - generates the RDS master password when none is supplied
#     (modules/rds, the deliverable of this theme).
