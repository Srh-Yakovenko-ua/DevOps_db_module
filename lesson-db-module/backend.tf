# Remote state stored in S3 with DynamoDB used for state locking.

# The bucket name is account specific (it is derived from the AWS account id),
# so it is not hardcoded here. It is supplied at init time with
# -backend-config="bucket=..." which `make bootstrap` and `make init` do
# automatically. This keeps the project universal: any account can deploy it
# without editing the code (see README.md).
